👋 Hi, I’m @ikuroyoru  
🎮 I'm passionate about video games and currently developing my first 2D platformer in Unity.  
🌱 I’m currently learning Unity, C#, and Git — and also improving my English and Japanese (JLPT N5).  
🌍 I’m looking for international opportunities in game development.  
🤝 I’m open to collaborating on indie game projects or anything that helps me grow as a game developer.
